Identify all of the variables, object property names, primitive values, and objects shown in the following code (assume the code has not been executed). Don't panic if you miss a few items - this exercise is more challenging than it looks.

    function hello(greeting, name) {
      return greeting + ' ' + name;
    }

    function xyzzy() {
      return { a: 1, b: 2, c: [3, 4, 5], d: {} };
    }

    const howdy = hello('Hi', 'Grace');
    let foo = xyzzy();

Variables:
hello
greeting 
name
xyzzy
howdy
foo 
Note: 'Hi' and 'Grace' are arguments, not parameters

Primitive:
' '
a
1
b
2
c
3, 4, 5
d
{}
'Hi'
'Grace'
0, 1, and 2 for the array indexes of [3, 4, 5].

Object property names:
a
b
c
d
It's also worth noting that array indexes are property names, so 0, 1, and 2 are property names for the [3, 4, 5] array. 

Objects: 
hello()
xyzzy()
{ a: 1, b: 2, c: [3, 4, 5], d: {} }
[3, 4, 5]
{}
