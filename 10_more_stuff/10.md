This exercise has nothing to do with this chapter. Instead, it uses concepts you learned earlier in the book. If you can't figure out the answer, don't worry: this question can stump developers with more experience than you have.

Consider this code:
> let x = "5"
> x = x + 1
= "51"

Now, consider this code:
> let y = "5"
> y++
What gets returned by y++ in the second snippet, and why?

Solution:
The numeric value 5 will be returned. Javascript will coerce "5" into a number (because ++ was applied to a string). y++ increments the value to 6, however the return value is 5.  The post-increment operator returns the original value rather than the incremented value. y++ is not the same as y = y + 1 or y += 1. However, if y had been incremented using ++y, the return value would have been 6.
