What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?

Answer:

Exception handling allows Javascript to deal with errors in a maneagable and predictable manner, halting a program if the program does not catch the exception. This is achieved through the try/catch statement. When writing code, one can perform an operation that may produce an error (try), and then tell Javascript what do if the error did occurr (catch).
