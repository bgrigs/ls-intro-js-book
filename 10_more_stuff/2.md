What does this error message and stack trace tell you?

Answer:
This tells me that an error occurred on the fourth line (^) of the exercise2.js file. The message goes on to say that the variable greeting was never defined and that the error was encountered on column 15 (line 4) within the hello function. Line 8 tells us that the hello function was called on Line 13 in an anonymous function. 

Note: The rest of the output comes from running the code in node and probably isn't useful to you as an application programmer.
