let counter = 0;

while (counter = 1) {
  console.log(counter);
  counter += 1;

  if (counter > 2) {
    break;
  }
}

This code causes an infinite loop (a loop that never stops iterating). Why?

Answer: When line 5 is executed, counter becomes equal to 2 and does not meet the test on line 7.  Line 3 reassignns counter to 1 each time the loop runs, not allowing counter to ever become higher than 2.
