        function multiply(left, right) {
          let product = left * right;
          return product;
        }

        function getNumber(prompt) {
          return parseFloat(question(prompt));
        }

        let left = getNumber('Enter the first number: ');
        let right = getNumber('Enter the second number: ');
        console.log(`${left} * ${right} = ${multiply(left, right)}`);


Identify all of the variables named on each line of the code. You may assume that question is the name of a built-in function in JavaScript (it is not, so this code won't work as written).

Line 1: multiply, left, right
Line 2: product, left, right
Line 3:  product
Line 6: getNumber, prompt
Line 7: parseFloat, question, prompt
Line 10: left, getNumber
Line 11: right, getNumber
Line 12: console, left, right, multiply

Note from solution: console is the variable name for the built-in Console object. In contrast, console.log is the name of a method in that object. As such, log is a property name, not a variable name.
