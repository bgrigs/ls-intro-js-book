        function multiply(left, right) {
          let product = left * right;
          return product;
        }

        function getNumber(prompt) {
          return parseFloat(question(prompt));
        }

        let left = getNumber('Enter the first number: ');
        let right = getNumber('Enter the second number: ');
        console.log(`${left} * ${right} = ${multiply(left, right)}`);


Using the code from Exercise 9, are the left and right variables on lines 1 and 2 the same as the left and right variables on lines 10-12? Explain your reasoning.

Answer: 

The left and right variables on lines 1 and 2 are parameters and local variables within the multiply() function. 

The left and right variables on lines 10-12 are global variables. They were declared in the global scope on lines 10 and 11. In line 12, they will output the values that were returned from the function
