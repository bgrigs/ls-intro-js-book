In the following code, what are the final length values for array1, array2, array3, array4, and array5?

    let array1 = [1, 2, undefined, 4]; // undefined is part of the length of the array

    let array2 = [1];
    array2.length = 5; // the length property assigned a new length to the array, over-riding the previous length. The array is now: [ 1, <4 empty items> ]

    let array3 = [];
    array3[-1] = [1]; // Index positions must be non-negative integers starting from 0. Negative and non-integer indexes don't get taken into account when determining an array's length.

    let array4 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    array4.length = 3; // the length of the array has been truncated to a new length, removing the last two items

    let array5 = [];
    array5[100] = 3; // because of zero-based indexing, if an index of 100 is added, the length is 101

Answers: 
    array1: 4 
    array2: 5
    array3: 0 
    array4: 3
    array5: 101
