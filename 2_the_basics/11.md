What value does the following expression evaluate to?
parseInt('3.1415')

Answer: 3. parseInt converts strings that begin with a digit to their numeric equivalent. If it encounters a non-digit, it stops converting. In this case parseInt converts the 3 and stops converting when it encounters the period.
